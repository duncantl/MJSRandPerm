How much speedup is needed to make this viable?

Most likely in the lme4/nlme fitting, but maybe generating the permutations.

Looks like can parallelize this. So get on a large machine and run in parallel.


Within the loop, there is a loop from 1:ageN and then set the first two names names of the result to
age and estimate. Is the same value of 2 for  ageN = 2 and setting the 2 names a coincidence or
supposed to be connected.  Probably a coincidence.



Rather than append  LMEMis_output_RP_oneIter to LMEMis_output_RP_allIter in each iteration,
+ pre-allocate and fill in rows
+ keep as a list until the very end and then use do.call(rbind, LMEMis_output_RP_allIter)


Set the names later.

Do the between at the end in vectorized form. 2 steps for the young and old corresponding to the two
values of ageArray.


+ dfMissing_pairedWide_RP is assigned but never used in each iteration.
  + And this involves the list[] which probably has a non-trivial overhead and uses non-standard evaluation.
  + So we can simplify this in the loop with
```
  fit.LMEMis_RP <- pairTrials_RandomPerm(dfMissing)[[2]]
```
  + Can also think about simplifying the function and not computing/returning the first element
  
Good to put names on the elements of the list returned by pairTrials_RandomPerm
  + this allows us to use 
  `pairTrials_RandomPerm(dfMissing)$fit`
  rather than `pairTrials_RandomPerm(dfMissing)[[2]]`


  


These changes seem to ADD 10 seconds, i.e., for rpIter = 100
+ origScript.R takes 130 seconds
+ the modified script (commit 10264bb4a) takes 140.
Not sure these numbers are reliable, and they should change when we do a lot more iterations.


Â¿ Remove emmeans:: qualifier for speed ?

### ls()

```r

box = new.env(); system.time(source("MJ&Serena_RandPermutationScript_20220202.R", box))
ls.calls = ls.stack()

1504 calls for 10 iterations.

After profiling and seeing .External2 as the most time consuming function,
we used LLDB to get the names of the routines being called via .External2.
That shows a lot of vctrs, rlang, magrittr_pipe (see Changes.md).
So where are these coming from. Let's look at the functions used in
pairTrials_RandomPerm.


```
g = getGlobals(pairTrials_RandomPerm)
gfuns = unique(g$functions)
where = sapply(gfuns, find)
notFromBase = !sapply(where, function(x) length(x) == 1 && x == "package:base")
where[notFromBase]
```
```
$complete.cases
[1] "package:stats"

$`%>%`
[1] "package:tidyr"   "package:stringr" "package:dplyr"  

$pivot_wider
[1] "package:tidyr"

$bind_rows
[1] "package:dplyr"

$lmer
[1] "package:lmerTest" "package:afex"     "package:lme4"    

$list
[1] ".GlobalEnv"     "package:gsubfn" "package:base"  
```

There is only one use of %>% in the function
```
dfMissing_NoNA_SubjectSubset %>% 
      pivot_wider(names_from = emotion, names_sep = ".", values_from = c(meanAmpNC, ACTOR, presentNumber, presentNumberWeight))
```
and it is unnecessary as it is more typing than just adding it as the first argument in the call.



As we saw in the loop, we can avoid bind_rows  and concatenation at each iteration with
do.call(rbind, )



+ sample(1:sum(emotionRows_A)) can be sample(sum(emotionRows_A))

+ Might be better or worse to do table(emotion) and then access the "A" and "B" elements.
  + May be overhead.
  
+ Compute dfMissing_pairedWide_SubjectSubset$meanAmpNC_BMinusA   at the end of the loop on the
  entire combined data.frame.

In the test for meanAmpNC.B in the names, replace & with && since scalar comparisons.


?  When removing all rows with NA, are there specific columns that can actually contain a NA,  or
   can any column.
   
   
   
   
## Removing confusing multiple return assignments that are not used - use of list[]   

```
library(rstatic)
ast = to_ast(parse("origScript_noFuns.R"))
df = find_nodes(ast, is_symbol, "trialCount")   
df = find_nodes(ast, is_symbol, "subjectCaseDeletion")
```
